Getting Started
---------------
### How do I set this up?
The easiest way to get started is to clone the repository:
``` bash
# Get the latest snapshot
$git clone git@github.com:AsianTechInc/AT-boilerplate-rails-devise.git myproject

# Change directory
$cd myproject

#Run bundle install to install all the gems we are using.
$bundle install
```
[Configure your local database connection](#database_config)

You can now run the app as normal:

``` bash
$rails s
```

### <a name="database_config"></a>Database Connections
```bash
$mv config/database.yml.sample config/database.yml
```
In `config/database.yml` we need to change the database names to what you want to use for your app. This app is setup using a database located on the same machine.
```ruby
# config/database.yml
default: &default
  adapter: mysql2
  encoding: utf8
  pool: <%= ENV.fetch("RAILS_MAX_THREADS") { 5 } %>
  username: your-username
  password: your-password
  socket: /tmp/mysql.sock

development:
  <<: *default
  database: your_database_development
```

we can go ahead and create our databases locally:
```bash
bundle exec rails db:create db:migrate db:seed_fu
```

Running the Test Suite
---------------
We are using `Rspec` for testing. To run the exisitng tests in command line type:
```bash
rspec
```
